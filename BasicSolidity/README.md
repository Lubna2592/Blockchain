##Prime Number Sum
Title: Writing a Solidity Program to Sum All Prime Numbers from 1 to 300
Objective: The objective of this lab is to design and implement a Solidity
program that calculates the sum of all prime numbers from 1 to 300.
Prerequisites:
● Basic understanding of Solidity programming language
● Familiarity with Ethereum development tools (e.g., Remix, Truffle)
● Access to a test Ethereum network (e.g., Ganache, Ropsten)
Requirements:
● Solidity compiler
● Remix or another Solidity development environment


##ReverseInteger
Title: Writing a Solidity Program to Reverse Digits of a Positive Integer
Objective: The objective of this lab is to design and implement a Solidity
program that takes a positive integer as input and returns the integer obtained
by reversing its digits.
Prerequisites:
● Basic understanding of Solidity programming language
● Familiarity with Ethereum development tools (e.g., Remix, Truffle)
● Access to a test Ethereum network (e.g., Ganache, Ropsten)
Requirements:
● Solidity compiler
● Remix or another Solidity development environment
